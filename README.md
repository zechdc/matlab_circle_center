matlab_circle_center
====================

This matlab script uses a live feed from a webcam to find the center of a target, then determine the distance from the target and play an audio tone that increases in frequency based on the distance from the center. The original purpose of this project was to make a rifle that blind people could use. It was designed as a class project at FHV - Fachhochschule Vorarlberg. It works in a very constrained environment as is described in the README file.
